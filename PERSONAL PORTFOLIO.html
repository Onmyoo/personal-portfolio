                <h3>1. What is HTML?</h3>
                <p>HTML is the main language used to create web pages. It helps organize and display content like text, images, and links on a website.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>2. Basic Structure of a Web Page</h3>
                <p>Every web page has a basic setup. It includes a section for important background information like the title, and another section where all the visible content, such as text, pictures, and buttons, appears.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>3. How HTML Works</h3>
                <p>HTML uses special keywords, called tags, to define different parts of a webpage. Some tags create paragraphs, headings, and lists, while others add images, videos, or links. Some tags need an opening and closing part, while others stand alone.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>4. Text and Headings</h3>
                <p>Web pages can have different text styles. There are six heading sizes, from the largest to the smallest. Regular text is placed in paragraphs, and there are options to make words bold, italic, or underlined.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>5. Lists on a Web Page</h3>
                <p>HTML allows two main types of lists: one that uses numbers and another that uses bullet points. Each item in the list is added one by one in a structured way.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>6. Creating Links</h3>
                <p>Web pages often include links that take users to different pages. A link can open another website, go to a different page within the same site, or even jump to a specific section on the same page.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>7. Adding Images</h3>
                <p>Pictures can be placed on a webpage using HTML. Each image needs a file location, and a short description can be added in case the image doesnâ€™t load.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>8. Making Tables</h3>
                <p>Tables help organize information in rows and columns. The first row usually contains headings, and the rest of the table is filled with data.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>9. Collecting Information with Forms</h3>
                <p>Forms allow users to enter and send information. They can include spaces to type text, buttons to click, options to select, and menus to choose from. These are useful for things like login pages, search bars, and online surveys.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>10. Extra Settings in HTML</h3>
                <p>Some additional settings help customize elements on a webpage. These settings can define where a link goes, where an image is stored, or even give names to sections of the page to help with design and programming.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-list learning-list">
                <h3>11. Adding Multimedia</h3>
                <p>Web pages can include audio and video content. Users can play, pause, or repeat media, and in some cases, the media can start playing automatically when the page loads.</p>
